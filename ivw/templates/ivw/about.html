        <h1 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: normal; color: black; font-size: 1.8rem;">About This Project</h1>
        <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 0.95rem;">
            This web application is developed as part of a <strong>Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA)</strong>.
            It is designed to assist <strong>Instituto Voar</strong>, from <strong>Prima Inova</strong>, in organizing
            and categorizing stakeholder demands effectively.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 0.95rem;">
            The system allows <strong>Francisleide Pustilnik</strong> and her team to manage demands following the
            <strong>AA1000 Accountability Standards</strong>, ensuring proper classification, prioritization, and tracking
            of programs aimed at addressing these demands.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold" style="font-size: 0.95rem;">Below is the success criteria that the system must fulfill:</p>

                                <li>Users can register and edit stakeholders, materiality principles outlined by the AA1000 standards, the United Nation’s SDGs, and programs executed by “Instituto Voar” in response to demands.</li>
                                <li>Users can register and edit new demands, specifying its title and description, while the system automatically stores its date of submission.</li>
                                <li>Users can categorize demands by associating them with one or more stakeholders, materiality principles, and SDGs.</li>
                                <li>Users can rate demands on a 1-5 scale for potential impact, implementation efforts, and beneficiaries. The average of these ratings should be automatically stored by the system under the “significance” field.</li>
                                <li>After creation, demands are automatically classified as “awaiting prioritization,” but users can change the status of a demand as “approved” or “canceled.”</li>

                                <li>The system allows associating approved demands with response programs executed by “Instituto Voar.”</li>
